  "selling": {
    "q1": "Is it okay if this is my first time selling an app or web service?",
    "a1": "Yes, APPEXIT provides dedicated support throughout the entire selling process. From price assessment to listing materials creation, buyer matching, contracts, and handovers, we provide consistent support, so even first-timers can use our service with peace of mind.",
    "q2": "Can I sell even with low monthly revenue?",
    "a2": "Yes, sales from 10,000 yen per month are possible. APPEXIT actively handles small projects from individual developers. Even if current revenue is low, future growth potential is acceptable.",
    "q3": "What is the market price range for selling?",
    "a3": "Generally, SaaS is 12-24 months of monthly revenue, apps are 6-12 months, EC sites are 3-6 months, and media is 6-18 months. Our free AI price assessment provides accurate pricing.",
    "q4": "Are payments processed within the platform?",
    "a4": "No, APPEXIT is a matching platform and does not process direct payments within the platform. After matching, dedicated staff contact both parties via email and conduct physical verification through escrow settlement. This prevents fraud and ensures safety."
  },
  "buying": {
    "q1": "Is it okay if this is my first time buying an app or web service?",
    "a1": "Yes, dedicated staff will support the purchase process. From project selection, due diligence (detailed investigation), price negotiation, contracts, to handovers, we provide consistent support, so even first-timers can feel secure.",
    "q2": "Can I start operating immediately after purchase?",
    "a2": "Yes, you can start operations immediately with handover support. We support smooth handovers including technical transfer, domain transfer, data migration, and operational manual provision.",
    "q3": "What is escrow settlement?",
    "a3": "Escrow settlement is a secure payment method where dedicated staff physically verify transactions. Specifically, we verify code quality (review actual source code) and fund availability (confirm buyer's payment capability). The handover proceeds only after all verifications are complete, eliminating the risk of fraud."
  },
  "aboutService": {
    "q1": "What is APPEXIT's greatest strength?",
    "a1": "Physical verification through escrow settlement. Instead of direct transactions within the platform, dedicated staff contact both parties via email and physically verify code quality and fund availability. This completely prevents fraud and misconduct that cannot be prevented by other platforms.",
    "q2": "What's the difference from other platforms?",
    "a2": "APPEXIT is a matching platform, not just a trading platform. After matching, dedicated staff intervene and conduct physical verification, making it significantly safer. Our method can completely prevent fraud that platform-based payment systems like Flippa and Acquire.com cannot prevent."
  },
  "procedures": {
    "q1": "Is there free consultation?",
    "a1": "Yes, we offer online briefings (free, reservation required) and individual consultations (free, confidential). NDA signing is also possible.",
    "q2": "Can you explain the transaction flow?",
    "a2": "1. Matching: Match sellers and buyers on the platform, 2. Contact: Dedicated staff contact both parties via email, 3. Verification: Physical verification of code quality and funds through escrow settlement, 4. Handover: Handover proceeds after all verifications complete. This flow ensures maximum safety."
